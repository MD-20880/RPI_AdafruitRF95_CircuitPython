Brief Introduction:
=
This project is a purpose-based technology solution to enable low-cost, low-power, and easy-to-deploy home use wireless sensor network.

This solution Includes:
1. A Simple WireLess Sensor Network **Network layer** Communication Protocols.
2. An implementation of Communication Protocols based on Raspberry pi pico(MCU), Raspberry pi zero (SBC), and Rfm9x Lora Unit(Data link	Layer implementation).
3. A Toolchain that could manipulate transfered data for Application Use.



Project is based on raspberry raspberry pi series dev-boards and LoRa communication protocol. 

The initial purpose of this project is to provide a sensor module to Raspberry pi based smart home periferials. However, the project may not specific to raspberry pi and Lora communication protocol. It should be able to compatible to any platforms or communication protocols as long as the sensor could transport data in specific format.

Currently, there are plenty of research on wireless sensor network, and there are also plenty of exist instances of communication protocols. However, most of them are complex and not friendly. This issule extremely slow down the pace of massive iot device deployment.
If there exist a simple protocol that can be understood by anyone with (just a little ) electronics background. then it can encourage more iot device deployment. 

Aim
==

This project is aimed to design a home use wireless sensor network. Such kind of network always has flowing properties: 
1. All sensors will be arranged with in a specific range ( Usually within 1 KM )




Home use sensor, especially sensors in hard-to-reach region should be able to last longer without any change in battery. 
According to reasons above, I choose LoRa as our communication protocol. 

According to our usage, "routing" behavior is not necessory since a single lora unit could cover almost the entire required area. Since the behavior is simple, a self defined ad-hoc network would be a better choice since it will reduce the dificulties on configuring a sensor network.   





# Communication Protocol Design

The Communication Protocol Design is following [**Protocol Design Principles whitepaper**](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/protocol-design-principles) guidence and instructions.

### Who will gonna need this
SensorPi provide a basic framework to facilitate fast long-range wireless sensor delployment solution. This framework help users manage data transformations between multiple devices that:
- Unable to hold long term stable real time connectios.
- Next Connection is scheduled but not predictable
- Doesn't Support Higher Level Communication protocols.


The SensorPi protocols are designed to be used under
1. Ad-hoc Wireless Sensor Network(E.g Temperary Experiment Environment Monitoring)
2. Security Unessential Wireless Sensor Network (E.g Daily temperature monitor, humidity monitoring.)

### Revelation

SensorPi Protocols Allow Device Nodes communicate between Nodes in a async manner. 

Device nodes could be various. But in most cases, Device node will collect data from its environment and transpot data by broadcasting it trhough microelectronic waves. In this case, the information leak is possible.


### Security
In SensorPy, Data are all transmitted via a public channel. Eveyone with the system knowledge could get information easily. Therefore, you **can't** setup end divicies that get involved into confidential/life threatening data since this may cause serious consequences. Although you can transmitted encrypted information, your information are still transmitted under a unsafe environment.
Therefore, we suggest this protocol only be used under ad-hoc/non-significant wireless sensor network deployment.

When deploy sensor network with this protocol, device nodes should only deployed as **Sensor** but not **Actuator**, which means your device should not manipulate 


Packet Design:
==
### Packet Format:
Every data Transmission should follow format below:

MAGIC_CODE(1 Byte) | DEVICE_ID (1 Byte) | TIMESTAMP (4 Byte) | PAGE_LEFT(1 Byte) | DATA

MAGIC_CODE is 

DEVICE_ID is

TIMESTAMP is

PAGE_LEFT is



|magic number:     |       Direction    |
|-------------------------------------|
|0x10 - NODE_ACK  |    Node -> Gateway|    
|0x11 - GATWAY_ACK   | Gateway -> Node|
|0x12 - Sending Data  |Node -> Gateway|
|0x13 - Maching       |Node -> Gateway|
|0x14 - Command       |Gateway -> Node|
|0x15 - Requesting Data |Gateway -> Node|


### COMMUNICATION TABLE:
START WITH |    RESPOND
|------------------------|
NODE_ACK | GATWAY_ACK
NODE_SENDING | GATWAY_ACK
GATEWAY_COMMAND | NODE_ACK
GATEWAY_REQUEST | NODE_ACK


All data should be either predefined value or ascii coded string.

For Each sensor Type, We Should Set a "DEFAULT FORMAT" to that specific type. However, If you want to customize your sensor data, you should write a "DataParser" to help manage how your data look like.



## Communication Process:
The Communication is always initiated by sensor node starting with NODE_ACK ,NODE_SENDING, or NODE_MATCHING and end with GATEWAY_ACK.

After Sending packet, Gateway need to open a short period of listen in order to receive response from Gateway.


Concepts:
===

Sensor:

    Device Sensor:
    Platform Sensor: The term platform sensor refers to platform interfaces, with which the user agent interacts to obtain sensor readings for a single sensor type originated from one or more device sensors.


RPI Gateway Behavior:

    *Gateway* is the device that able to access and control *Sensor Nodes* belong to this *Sensor Network* 

    Gateway will collect data readings from Sensor Network and forward it to permanent storages.

    User should be able to achive following actions by accessing to a Gateway:
    1. List All Available Sensors
    2. Access Sensor Node Through its ID
    3. Access Sensor readings through its ID
    4. Setup interesting scenarios 
    5. Set Sensors to IDLE state
    6. Set Sensors to WORKING state
    


Sensor Node Behavior:

    Each sensor node have its own properties including:
        1. Sensor ID 
        2. Sensor Status

    When sensor Node start working. it will first at INIT state, at this stage, sensor node will broadcasting packet start with 0x13 followed with its own ID. At this stage, when any other LoRa devices ack it with 0x14 followed with this() sensor's ID. It will then stop broadcasting and entering WORKING state

    At WORKING stage, sensor node will continuously collect data in a default collecting frequency and send it to gateway. Each data should follow with a timestep to indicate when the data is collected. 
    At the same time, sensor will also actively receive command from gateway.
    The sensor node will automatically enter IDLE state after MAX_WORKING_TIME to save energy.

    AT IDLE state, sensor node will ack to Gateway with default every 30 second as a live check. If gateway is still online or not busying, the sensor node should receive a "Ack back" or a command from gateway.
    If nothing is received, it will start a sequence of quick acking to the gate way trying to receive "Ack back" from the gateway. When reach maximum trials, sensor will goes to DISCONNECT state. 



    AT DISCONNECT state, sensor will also collect data in a default collecting frequency, at the same time, it will constantly trying to get contact with gate way by sending Maching request.
